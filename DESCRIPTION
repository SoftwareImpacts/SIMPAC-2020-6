Description: The bayesvl R package provides users with a program and its associated functions for pedagogical purposes in using Bayesian networks and MCMC computations. It enables users to: a) Create and examine the (starting) graphical structure of Bayesian networks; b) Create random Bayesian networks using a dataset with customized constraints; c) Generate Stan code for structures of Bayesian networks for sampling the data and learning parameters; d) Plot the network graphs; e) Perform MCMC computations and produce graphs for posteriors checks. The package refers to one reference item, which describes the methods and algorithms: Vuong, Quan-Hoang, and La Viet-Phuong. (2019). The bayesvl R package. Open Science Framework (May 18).
